Most Common Aggregate Functions: // Aggregate function calls happen only in the SELECT or HAVING clause.
- AVG() = average returns a floating point value with many decimal places, might be best to use with ROUND() to specify precision after the decimal
- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()


SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;      // Minimum replacement cost for a film, MIN and MAX only returns a single value

SELECT MAX(replacement_cost), MIN(replacement_cost)

CREATING DATABASES AND TABLES 

Data Types:

- Boolean: T or F
- Character: char, varchar and text
- Numeric: integer and floating-point number
- Temporal: date, time, timestamp and interval
NOT SO COMMON 
- UUID: universallly unique identifiers
- Array: Stores an array of srtings, numbers, etc 
- JSON
- Hstore key-value pair
- Special types such as network address and geometric data 


PK = Primary key to a table
FK = Foreign Key to another table which can be located at the constraints properties/dependencies 
Constraints = rules enforced on data columns on table, which prevent invalid data from being entered into the database

Column Constraints
MOST USED:
- NOL NULL: Column cannot have NULL value.
- UNIQUE: Ensures that all column values are different.
- PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table
- FOREIGN Key: Contraints data based on columns in other tables.
- CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.
- EXCLUSION: Ensures that if any 2 rows are compared on the specified column or expression using the specified operator, not all of these comparisons will return TRUE.

Table constraints
MOST USED:
- CHECK: checks a condition when inserting or updating data.
- REFERENCES: to contrain the value stores in the complumn that mujst exist in a column in another table.
- UNIQUE(column_list): forces the values stored in the columns listed inside the parenthesis to be unique.
- PRIMARY KEY(column_list): Allows to define the primary key that consist of multiple columns.


CREATE Table syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name TYPE column_constraint,
    column_name TYPE column_constraint,
    table_constraint table_constraint 
)INHERITS existing_table_name;

easy example:
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    age SMALLINT NOT NULL
)

 SERIAL: Logs unique integer entries for you automatically upon insertion. It creates a sequence object and set the next value generated by the sequence as the defaulkt value of the column
         NOTE: If a row is later removed, the SERIAL data type will not adjust.

CREATE TABLE account(
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(250) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	last_login TIMESTAMP
)

CREATE TABLE job(
	job_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	job_name VARCHAR (200) UNIQUE NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE account_job(
	user_id INTEGER REFERENCES account(user_id),
	job_id INTEGER REFERENCES job(job_id),
	hire_date TIMESTAMP
	
)


INSERT : allows you to add rows to a table

INSERT syntax:

INSERT INTO table (column1, column2,.....)
VALUES 
(value1, value2,.....),
(value1, value2,,,,,);

When inserting values from another table, keep in mind that:
1. The inserted row valkues must match up for the table, including constraints.
2. SERIAL columns do not need to be provided a value

INSERT INTO table(column1, columns2,...)
SELECT column1, column2,....
FROM another_table
WHERE condition;

examples using previously created database:

INSERT INTO account(username, password, email, created_on)
VALUES 
('Jose', 'password', 'jose@mail.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

INSERT INTO job(job_name)
VALUES 
('Astronaut')

INSERT INTO account_job(user_id, job_id, hire_date)
VALUES 
('1', '1', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)


UPDATE: allows for the changing of values of the column in a table

UPDATE Syntax:

UPDATE table
SET column1 = value1,
    column2 = value2,...
WHERE
    condition;


UPDATE account
SET last_login = created_on;

UPDATE join using another table's values:
UPDATE TableA
SET original_col = TableB.new_col
FROM tableB
WHERE tableA.id = TableB.id

UPDATE account
SET last_login = created_on
RETURNING account_id, last_login;

UPDATE account_job
SET hire_date = account.created_on
FROM account
WHERE account_job.user_id = account.user_id;


DELETE: removes rows from a table

DELETE Syntax:

DELETE FROM table
WHERE row_id = 1 

DELETE FROM tableA
USING TableB
WHERE tableA.id = TableB.id

DELETE FROM table       // deletes all rows.

DELETE can also be used with RETURNING like UPDATE

DELETE FROM job
WHERE job_name = 'Cowboy'
RETURNING job_id, job_name


ALTER: Allows for changes to an existing table structure, such as: Adding, dropping or renaming columns, changing a column data type, setting a column values to DEFAULT, renaming, and adding CHECK contraints.

ALTER Syntax:

Adding column
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN newcol_name

Removing column
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN col_name

Alter column contraints
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN col_name
SET DEFAULT value      // SET NOT NULL  // DROP NOT NULL // ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name

Examples:

Renaming table

ALTER TABLE information
RENAME TO new_info;


Renaming column 

ALTER TABLE new_info
RENAME COLUMN person TO people;


Removing a NOT NULL constraint from column

ALTER TABLE new_info
ALTER COLUMN people DROP NOT NULL


Setting a column constraint

ALTER TABLE new_info
ALTER COLUMN people SET NOT NULL

For more info on ALTER check: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable-html


DROP: Allow for the complete removal of a column in a table, including indexes and constraints involving the column, however it does not remove columns used in views, triggers or stores procedures (dependencies) without an additional CASCADE clause.

DROP Syntax:

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN col_name

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN col_name CASCADE

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS col_name

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN col_one,
DROP COLUMN col_two

Examples:

ALTER TABLE new_info
DROP COLUMN people

ALTER TABLE new_info
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS people


CHECK: allows us to create more customized contraints that adhere to a certain condition such as making sure all inserted integer values fall below a certain threshold.

CHECK Syntax:

CREATE TABLE example(
    ex_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    age SMALLINT CHECK(age>27),
    parent_age SMALLINT CHECK(parent_age > age)
);

Examples:

CREATE TABLE employee(
	emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	birthdate DATE CHECK(birthdate > '1900-01-01'),
	hire_date DATE CHECK(hire_date > birthdate)
	salary INTEGER CHECK(salary > 0)
)



Assessment test 3

Complete the following task:

Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,

homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:

 We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.

 We must have ids as the primary key of the tables

Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.

Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.

Keep in mind that these insert tasks may affect your constraints!

Best of luck and example scripts are available in the next lecture.
