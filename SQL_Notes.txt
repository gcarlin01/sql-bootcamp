SELECT * FROM film;	// Selects all columns from film table

SELECT * FROM actor;	   // selects all columns from actor table

SELECT last_name, first_name FROM actor;    // selects last_name and first_name columns from actor table

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2007-02-01' AND '2007-02-15';      // count of all payments done between Feb 1st and 15 (BETWEEN is exclusive, so no transactions 																	done on the 15 will show up,  in contrast NOT BETWEEN is Inclusive

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (0.99, 1.99, 1.98);      // Instead of doing WHERE …AND …AND, just use IN for multiple WHERE statements, it can be used with NOT as well as NOT IN 

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%' AND last_name LIKE 'S%';      // LIKE = case sensitive uses _ wildcard for any 1 letter and % for any number of letters and ILIKE does the 															same but is case unsensitive, % takes blank as well. LIKE and ILIKE also take the NOT operator

Most Common Aggregate Functions: // Aggregate function calls happen only in the SELECT or HAVING clause.
- AVG() = average returns a floating point value with many decimal places, might be best to use with ROUND() to specify precision after the decimal
- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()


SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;      // Minimum replacement cost for a film, MIN and MAX only returns a single value

SELECT MAX(replacement_cost), MIN(replacement_cost)
FROM film;                                                // This will come back as two values MIN and MAX 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost), 2)
FROM film;                                          // AVG of replacement_cost rounded up to 2 decimal 

SELECT SUM(replacement_cost)
FROM film;                                      // SUM of replacement_cost

SELECT customer_id,SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;                                    // What are the top 5 customer ids that are expending the most amount of money

SELECT DATE(payment_date),SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date)
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;                  // DATE function returns the day for any timestamp (sec,min,hrs). What specific dates did we collect the most payment amounts
