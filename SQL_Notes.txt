SELECT * FROM film;	// Selects all columns from film table

SELECT * FROM actor;	   // selects all columns from actor table

SELECT last_name, first_name FROM actor;    // selects last_name and first_name columns from actor table

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment

Most Common Aggregate Functions: // Aggregate function calls happen only in the SELECT or HAVING clause.
- AVG() = average returns a floating point value with many decimal places, might be best to use with ROUND() to specify precision after the decimal
- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()


SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;      // Minimum replacement cost for a film, MIN and MAX only returns a single value

SELECT MAX(replacement_cost), MIN(replacement_cost)
FROM film;                                                // This will come back as two values MIN and MAX 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost), 2)
FROM film;                                          // AVG of replacement_cost rounded up to 2 decimal 

SELECT SUM(replacement_cost)
FROM film;                                      // SUM of replacement_cost

SELECT customer_id,SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;                                    // What are the top 5 customer ids that are expending the most amount of money

SELECT DATE(payment_date),SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date)
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;                  // DATE function returns the day for any timestamp (sec,min,hrs). What specific dates did we collect the most payment amounts


Challenge Questions:

1. How many payments did each staff member handle and who gets the bonus?

SELECT staff_id,COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id
ORDER BY COUNT(amount)DESC

2. What is the average replacement cost per MPAA rating?

SELECT rating, ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost), 2) 
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

3. What are the customer ids of the top 5 customers by total spend?

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) 
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;


SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;               // Using HAVING which comes after GROUP BY since WHERE comes before the GROUP BY and could not be used with SUM(amount) 


Challenge Questions: 

1. What customer_ids are elegible for platinum status(40 or more transaction payments)?

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(amount) >= 40;

2. What are the customer_ids of customers who have spent more than $100 in payment transactions with our staff_id member 2?

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = 2
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;


Assessment test:

1. Return the customer_ids of customers who have spent at least $110 with the staff member who has an id of 2?
2. How many films begin with the letter J?
3. What customer has the highest customer Id number whise name starts with an E and has an address Id lower than 500?

My answers: 
1.
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = 2
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) >= 110;

2. 
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE title LIKE 'J%';

3. 
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'E%' AND address_id < 500
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 1;


SELECT SUM(amount) AS net_revenue
FROM payment;                              // set a new name (net_revenue) for your column. the AS statement can only be present in the SELECT
